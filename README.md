This repository provides a basic structure for creating a custom GitHub action workflow. It includes:

* **.git**: The Git repository metadata.
* **.github**: This folder contains the workflow configuration files.

### Usage:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. **Replace `hello.txt`** with your desired content or file.
3. **Modify the workflow configuration files** in the `.github` directory to:
 README.md hello.txt Define the workflow's trigger events (e.g., push, pull request).
 README.md hello.txt Specify the steps involved in the workflow (e.g., run a script, build an artifact).
 README.md hello.txt Include custom actions you create or use existing actions from the GitHub Marketplace.
4. **Commit** your changes and **push** them to your repository.
5. **Configure your repository settings** to enable GitHub Actions and trigger the workflow.

This repository serves as a starting point for building your own customized workflows. You can adapt the provided structure and workflow definitions to suit your specific needs and project requirements.

**Note:** The provided `hello.txt` file is a placeholder and will need to be replaced with your actual content. The workflow files in `.github` will also need to be modified to define the desired actions and steps.
