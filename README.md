## custom-action-workflow

This repository contains a custom GitHub action workflow that can be used to automate various tasks within your repository.

**Description:**

This repository houses a custom action workflow designed for specific tasks. It may include:

* **Pre-built actions:** Utilizing pre-existing GitHub Actions to automate common processes (e.g., linting, testing, deployment).
* **Custom actions:** Defining custom actions within the workflow to perform unique tasks specific to your repository.
* **Workflow triggers:** Setting up triggers for the workflow, such as pull requests, pushes, or scheduled events.

**Usage:**

1. **Fork the repository:** Create a copy of the repository within your own GitHub account.
2. **Customize the workflow:** Modify the workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to suit your specific needs.
3. **Enable the workflow:** Activate the workflow within your repository's settings.

**Instructions:**

1. **Review the workflow file:** Understand the purpose and steps defined within the workflow file.
2. **Modify variables and parameters:** Adjust any predefined variables or parameters to match your environment.
3. **Add or modify actions:** Include or change actions based on your desired automation tasks.
4. **Test the workflow:** Trigger the workflow manually or through a defined event to ensure it runs as expected.
5. **Deploy the workflow:** Make sure the workflow is running automatically upon trigger events.

**Example:**

```yaml
name: CI

on:
 push:
 branches: [ main ]

jobs:
 build:
 runs-on: ubuntu-latest
 steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v3
 - name: Run tests
 run: npm run test
```

This example workflow triggers upon a push to the 'main' branch and runs tests using the `npm run test` command. You can adapt this template to your specific needs by adding or modifying actions and setting up custom triggers.
