# custom-action-workflow

## Description
## custom-action-workflow

This repository contains a simple GitHub Actions workflow demonstrating the creation and use of a custom action. It's a basic example, ideal for learning how to build and integrate custom actions into your workflows. The functionality is currently minimal (printing a message to the console). This is intended as a starting point for more complex custom actions.

**File Description:**

* `.git`: Standard Git repository metadata.
* `.github/`: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow definition.
* `hello.txt`: A sample text file (currently unused, could be incorporated into a more complex action).


**Usage Instructions:**

1. **Fork this repository:** Create a fork of this repository on your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the forked repository:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone <your_fork_url>`.
3. **(Optional) Modify the workflow:** Explore and modify the `.github/workflows/*.yml` file to customize the action's behavior. You'll likely want to replace the simple `echo` command with your custom action logic.
4. **Commit and push:** Commit any changes you make and push them to your forked repository.
5. **Observe the workflow run:** Navigate to the Actions tab in your forked repository. You should see a workflow run triggered by your push. Check the logs to see the output of your action.


This repository serves as a template. To make it useful, you will need to replace the placeholder action with your own custom action code. Remember to create a new action and push that code to this repository. Then adjust the workflow file to use your new custom action.
